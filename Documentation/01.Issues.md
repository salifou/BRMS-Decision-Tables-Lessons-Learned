# Issues

The following are issues that I ran into.  If you would like to add to this list, please do so.

## Auto Double Quotes Replacements

Both Excel and OpenOffice Spreadsheet replaces the text-based straight double quote (") with the fancy double quote (&ldquo; and &rdquo;).  This causes the BRMS engine to throw the following exceptions

```
[8,29]: [ERR 101] Line 8:29 no viable alternative at input ''
```

You would have to disable this features.
