# Issues

The following are issues that I ran into.  If you would like to add to this list, please do so.

## Auto Double Quotes Replacements

Both Excel and OpenOffice Spreadsheet replaces the text-based straight double quote (") with the fancy double quote (&ldquo; and &rdquo;).  This causes the BRMS engine to throw the following exceptions

```
[8,29]: [ERR 101] Line 8:29 no viable alternative at input ''
```

You would have to disable this features.

## Null Checks

Certain rules requires we check for `null` values.  Usually null checks are validation rules and probably should not be in the business rules, but sometimes it may require it.  The condition will look as follows:

The key is to use the <b>$1</b> inside the comments that will tell the BRMS engine the parameter is being used and prevent an exception error.

## String Comparison

There are several ways to compare two strings.  The best is to use the `.equals` or `.equalsIgnoreCase` within the object may be the best.
